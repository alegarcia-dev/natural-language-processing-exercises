       "'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeup offers a 13-week training program: Systems Engineering.\\xa0Designed to help you launch your career in tech, this program takes you from 0 experience to IT hero with certifications and hands-on experience in just weeks. But if you’re new to tech, you might be wondering…what is Systems Engineering?\\nWhat is Systems Engineering?\\nIn IT terms, a Systems Engineer (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like:\\n\\nReviewing system logs for anomalies and issues\\nUpdating operating systems (OS)\\nInstalling new hardware and software\\nManaging user accounts\\nDocumenting information about the system setup\\nManaging file systems\\n\\nYou might be thinking, “Woah, that looks like a lot!” and that’s because it is! A Systems Engineer is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today’s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don’t forget how the old saying actually ends: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.” So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses?\\n\\nNetworking – Networking skills include how to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot networks, including using hardware like switches, routers, and firewalls. These skills and concepts are crucial to any systems engineering position. You not only need to understand them but also need some way to prove it. With the Network+ certification, job seekers can come to employers with proof of their networking know-how.\\nLinux- Linux is one of the most popular Operating Systems (OS). It is fully compatible with Mac OS and underpins all Android systems. In fact, the world’s IT infrastructure is run primarily on Linux. Certifications are the primary way technical folks prove their skills and Linux is no different. The CompTIA Linux+ certification is an entry-level certification that proves knowledge and basic technical proficiency in the job role\\nCloud – This involves using servers and tools (i.e. processing and storage hardware) that are based in a different location, instead of on-site. Our program introduces students to cloud concepts like storage, computing, permissions, and more!\\n\\nWhy Become a Systems Engineer?\\nNow you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.\\xa0 Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.\\n\\nThey are in demand! Companies rely on Sysadmins to keep all their IT running\\nYou’ll become a tech guru! You won’t just be the person who can fix the printer. You’ll also be the person who can script, work with servers, navigate AWS Cloud tools, and work on modern web technologies.\\nYou can specialize! With the breadth of knowledge you’ll obtain, you can have a specialized career in IT. Just hone in on one of your interests, whether it’s security, cloud, databases, or something that doesn’t even exist yet!\\n\\nInterested in learning more? Sign up for our Network Fundamentals Crash Course to get a taste for these skills – a $500 value you can get for free!Ready to go all-in? Apply to our 13-week Systems Engineering program where you’ll earn your Network+ and Linux+ certifications, along with skills in AWS, LAMP, Microsoft, and more!\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n'"
